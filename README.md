# mask.on
Mask Any URL 

<br>

# Description 
Masked URLs, also known as URL cloaking or link masking, is a technique where the actual URL of a webpage is hidden and replaced with a different, more user-friendly URL in the browser's address bar. This allows websites to present a clean, branded, and easy-to-remember URL while redirecting users to a different, often complex, destination.
